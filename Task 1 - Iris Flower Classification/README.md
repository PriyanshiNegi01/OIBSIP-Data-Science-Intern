# Iris Flower Classification

The dataset contains samples of three different species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each species has 50 samples, resulting in a total of 150 samples.

The dataset consists of four features (attributes) measured from each iris flower:

Sepal Length (in centimeters) - The length of the sepal, which is the outer part of the flower that protects the bud.
Sepal Width (in centimeters) - The width of the sepal, measured at its broadest point.
Petal Length (in centimeters) - The length of the petal, which is the colorful leaf-like part of the flower.
Petal Width (in centimeters) - The width of the petal, measured at its widest point.
